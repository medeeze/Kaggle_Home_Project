##  
Home Credit would like to provide customers with the ability to request loans despite 
having a lack of credit history. Without credit history, it is difficult to predict the likeliness 
of a given customer to pay off their debt which is a risk lenders usually avoid.

Creating a model that can accurately predict a customerâ€™s likeliness of credit default. I trained a model using historical customer data given by Home Credit. This will be a supervised classification model that determines the probability of the target variable: credit default. Through the combination of calculating the significance of one variable and the relationship between multiple variables, a test set can be created to provide a probability of the target variable happening.
